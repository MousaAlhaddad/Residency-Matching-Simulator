# Residency Matching Simulator

The Saudi Commission for Health Specialties Matching System
(SCHFS-MS) is a national function that provides a fair and objective
application and matching system for SCFHS postgraduate training
programs

This is a personal attempt to build a program that simulates SCHFS-MS.

> [Matching.py](Matching.py)	starts by using the data stored on [Programs.xlsx](Programs.xlsx) which contains some historical estimations of the available yearly positions for each medical residency program in Saudi Arabia. The script then generates a random list of candidates with a matching score and 10 different choices for each candidate. At the end, an output file -[Matching.xlsx](Matching.xlsx)- is generated containing the matching results.
